## Plan of Technologies

- Backend: Django is a good choice for the backend of the web app. It is a powerful and popular web framework written in Python that provides many built-in features and tools for building web applications quickly and efficiently.

- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB can be used to store the data for the app. Both are widely used and well-regarded databases that can handle the needs of a web application like this. You can use Docker images to easily set up and manage the database in a containerized environment.

- Continuous integration and deployment: GitHub Actions can be used to set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflow for the app. This will allow you to automatically build, test, and deploy the app whenever you push changes to the repository.

- Containerization and deployment: To make it easy to deploy the app, you can containerize it using a tool like Docker. Then, you can use Kubernetes to manage and deploy the containers to a cloud provider like AWS. This will allow you to scale the app and make it more resilient to failures.

### Other technologies that could be useful for building this web app include:

- Frontend framework: A frontend framework like React or Vue.js could be used to build the user interface for the app. These frameworks provide a set of tools and components for building web applications with a modern, responsive design.

- Testing: To ensure the quality and reliability of the app, you can use a testing framework like Pytest or Jest to write and run automated tests.

- Monitoring: To track the performance and availability of the app, you can use a monitoring tool like Prometheus or New Relic to collect and visualize metrics and logs.

- Security: To secure the app and protect user data, you can use tools like SSL/TLS certificates and firewalls to encrypt traffic and block unauthorized access.

### Additional

- Authentication and authorization: To ensure that only authorized users can access the app and its features, you can implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. This can include login forms, API keys, and OAuth2 authentication.

- Access control: You can use access control mechanisms like role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user access to certain parts of the app based on their role or permissions.

- Data encryption: To protect sensitive user data, you can encrypt the data in transit and at rest using technologies like SSL/TLS and database encryption.

- Vulnerability scanning: To identify and fix vulnerabilities in the app and its dependencies, you can use a vulnerability scanning tool like Snyk or Nessus.

- Security monitoring: To detect and respond to security threats in real-time, you can use a security monitoring tool like Logz.io or Splunk to collect and analyze logs and alerts.

- Disaster recovery: To ensure the availability of the app in case of a disaster, you can implement a disaster recovery plan that includes backup and recovery procedures, redundant systems, and failover mechanisms.
